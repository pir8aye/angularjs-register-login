A basic example of user registration and login using AngularJS and Firebase.

## Installation
* Clone this repo to a folder on your server.
* Activate mod_rewrite, route all traffic to application's public/ folder.

### Create an Account
The first thing you need to do isÂ sign up for a free Firebase account and create a project.

### Add Firebase to the Project
You will need to initialise the Firebase SDK. To do this you'll need to create a `firebase.config.json` file in the application's root folder and add the following with your projects information:

```json
{
    "apiKey": "<your-api-key>",
    "authDomain": "<your-auth-domain>",
    "databaseURL": "<your-database-url>",
    "storageBucket": "<your-storage-bucket>"
}
```

### Install Components
Go to project folder and run the npm install command;

```bash
npm install
```
